# IETF Protocol Badges
Protocol badges are intended to support the deployment and use of IETF technologies.

A badge provides a visual representation that can be used by applications and services that have implemented a particular IETF protocol, or to promote awareness and use among developers.

Badges developed with the support of the IETF Administration LLC are made available and may be [downloaded via the IETF website](https://www.ietf.org/badges).

## Badge uses
An IETF protocol badge can be used  in a variety of contexts, including:
+ Laptop stickers
+ T-shirts
+ Github repositories related to an IETF working group
+ Informational websites

Badges are licensed by the [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org) under their [IETF Protocol Badge License](https://trustee.ietf.org/wp-content/uploads/IETF-Protocol-Badge-License-Terms.pdf)

## Badge development options
IETF Working Group Chairs interested in exploring the possiblity of working on protocol badge development can [request support from the IETF LLC](mailto:support@ietf.org). The badge development process always includes participation by WG Chairs, and may include input and review by a larger group of individuals.

### Customizable system
The IETF has an established badge system that can be applied to any protocol under development. This is used for protocols such as HTTP and PrivacyPass, for example. It is a quick and effective option in cases where timelines are short or where there isn’t (yet) a clear justification for the time, energy, and cost of a from-scratch badge development effort. Several high-profile IETF protocols, such as HTTP and PrivacyPass have adapted this customizable system.

### Clean sheet development
Clean sheet development for protocol badges start with a Design Brief that lays out several aspects, such as Support from the IETF LLC for clean sheet development of 1-2 protocol badges each year is typically available.
