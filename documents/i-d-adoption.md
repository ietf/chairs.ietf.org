1. Start an adoption call in the mailing list of your working group (e.e. `FOO`) by navigating to the documents tab in Datatracker after logging in:
`https://datatracker.dev.ietf.org/group/FOO/documents/`

2. Follow the link to the document page and use the "Manage adoption" button to see the "Manage Document Adoption dialog.

3. Select the desired Working Group from the "Group" dropdown menu.

5. The general value for "Expected weeks in adoption state" is "2", but may be set to other values based on chairs' decision.

6. Click the "Save" button to have the IETF Datatracker automatically issue a message to the WG mailing list announcing the call for adoption.

7. When an adoption call is successfully concluded on the WG mailing list, it is time to update the I-D state in the Datatracker. (Usually, a new revision of the document is required after an adoption call is concluded.) To indicate that the I-D is adopted, navigate to the I-D in Datatracker and click the “Edit” button next to “WG state” label.

9. Contact authors to request a new version with updated [I-D name](https://authors.ietf.org/en/naming-your-internet-draft). 

10. (Pre-)Approve the document. Make sure that “replaced by” is set.

9. Once the updated revision of the I-D has been submitted, set the state to “WG Document”.
