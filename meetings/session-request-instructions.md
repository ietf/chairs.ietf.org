The Session Request Tool may be used by IETF working group chairs, working group secretaries, IRTF research group chairs, IAB Group Chairs, Area Directors, IETF Secretariat members, Team Chairs, and the IRTF Chair to request sessions at upcoming IETF Meetings.

# Login
Use the same login information as for the IETF Meeting Materials Management tool.

# First Screen
This interface allows you to request a new session, or make changes to or cancel a previously requested session.

1. Request New Session
Acronyms of the working groups that you currently chair are listed in this section. Click on an acronym to initiate a request for a new session at the upcoming IETF meeting.

2. Edit / Cancel Previously Requested Sessions
Acronyms of the working groups for which you or your co-chair has requested sessions at the upcoming IETF meeting are listed in this section. Click on an acronym to initiate changes to a session, or cancel a session. If you’d like to make changes when the tool is Locked, email agenda@ietf.org.

3. Send Notification of No Session
If you know your working group will not plan to meet, please notify the Secretariat. Click on the group acronym and then choose the first option, “Send a notification that the group does not plan to hold a session at IETF ###.” This sends an email to the working group mail list and the Secretariat.

# Request New Session

To request a new session at an upcoming IETF meeting, complete all the required fields in the request form and confirm the information that was just entered.

1. Request Form
- Retrieve all information from previous meeting: If you held a session at the previous meeting, clicking this button will prefill every field in the tool. Please review the information carefully, particularly the conflict lists and Special Requests, to make sure it still applies.
- Number of Sessions: Drop down field. Select 1 or 2 sessions. This is a required field. 
- Length of Session: Two drop down fields which initially are disabled. Once you select the number of sessions to be requested, one or both of these fields will be enabled. (Note: The lengths of session options may vary from meeting to meeting.) These are required fields. 
- Additional Session Request: Check this box to request a third session for a working group. Additional slots may be available after agenda scheduling has closed and with the approval of an Area Director. Select the Length of Session from the associated drop-down field. 
- Number of Attendees: Enter the estimated number of attendees who will attend the sessions being requested. The default value is zero. This is a required field. 
- Conflicts to Avoid: Please list WG and RG sessions that should not be scheduled at the same time as yours according to the following three categories.
- Chair Conflicts: Enter a list of acronyms of working groups separated by commas to indicate other WGs the chairs also lead or actively participate in.
- Technology Overlap: Enter a list of acronyms of working groups separated by commas for other WGs with related technology or a closely related charter.
- Key Participant Conflict: Enter a list of acronyms of working groups separated by commas for WGs with which key participation (like presenters) may overlap. 
- Birds of a Feather (BOF) Sessions: Specify in free-form text any potential BOF groups that you wish to avoid for the sessions being requested. 
- Special Requests: Specify any special requests in this free-form text box, e.g., preferred days or times for your sessions. Also use this field to indicate BoFs or potential BoFs that will be conflicts.
- Save: Click on the 'Save' button when you have finished entering the information. You will have the opportunity to review the information, and revise it, if necessary. 

2. Confirmation
This screen is displayed after you click the 'Save' button on the request form (as described above). Review all the information that you have entered on the request form. When you are satisfied that the information is accurate, click on the 'Submit' button located at the bottom of the page. If you are requesting one or two sessions for the working group, a message will be sent to the working group list and the Secretariat. If you are requesting a third session for the working group, then a message will be sent to the Area Director(s) for approval of the third session as well as to the Secretariat and the working group list.

# Edit / Cancel Previously Requested Sessions

This interface allows you to either modify the information for a previously requested session, or cancel the session.  If the session request tool has closed, send email to agenda@ietf.org with your request.

When you click on the acronym of a working group for which a session has been previously requested, all of the information that was previously entered for this working group will be displayed as read only text. Two buttons are provided at the bottom of this page: `Edit` and `Cancel`.

1.1. Edit
Edit the previously entered information by clicking on the `Edit` button. When you click on this button, a form is displayed that contains all of the information previously entered for this session. Just as for the original request, update the information, confirm that the updated information is accurate, and click Save. Notifications will be sent to the Secretariat, working group, chairs, and Area Director(s) as appropriate.

1.2. Cancel
Cancel a previously requested session by clicking on the `Cancel` button. The tool will confirm this action via a pop-up window. Once confirmed, a notification will be sent to the Secretariat and CC'd to the Area Director(s) of the subject working group. Any links and information related to the subject working group will be deleted from the IETF Meeting Materials Management tool and the IETF Web site.
