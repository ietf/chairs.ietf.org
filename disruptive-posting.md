Regrettably, managing mailing lists sometimes includes handling disruption postings by participants. 

# Forms of disruptive posting
Disruptive postings can include, but are not limited to:

* Advertising and other unsolicited bulk e-mail (spam).
* Discussion of subjects unrelated to the purpose of the list.
* Unprofessional or uncivil commentary and personal attacks.
* Disrupting the consensus-driven process of a Working Group.

# List admin responsibilities
It is the responsibility of all list admins to manage such disruptive behaviour, ensure that mailing list discussions serve the purposes of the list and that the IETF Guidelines for Conduct (BCP 54) are adhered to. 

WG list admins, normally WG Chairs, are expected to follow the rules set out in RFC 3934 Updates to RFC 2418 Regarding the Management of IETF Mailing Lists, which describes a method for giving warnings and, in the face of continued disruptive posts, suspending the participants posting privileges on the Working Group mailing list. 

RG list admins, normally RG Chairs, are expected to follow the rules set out in RFC 9775 IRTF Code of Conduct.

# Relation to BCP 83
BCP 83 allows posting rights to be indefinitely revoked from the any IETF mailing list using a Posting Rights Action, following a community consensus process managed by the IESG. If a disruptive participant on your Working Group mailing list is subject to a BCP 83 Posting Rights Action on another IETF mailing list, as chair you may simply remove their posting privileges on your Working Group's list without following the process in RFC 3934.

# Harassment
Independent of any action you take as a list admin to manage your mailing list, if a particular disruption on the mailing list also constitutes harassment, then you can decide to confidentially make a report of harassment (as can any IETF participant) and the IETF Ombudsteam will investigate the report as such. You can also confidentially contact the Ombudsteam for advice about how to handle a situation without a formal investigation being undertaken.

# Further information
* Working Groups chairs encountering issues are advised to speak to their Area Director for both a heads-up and guidance. 
* For examples of what constitutes harassmemtn, see the [IETF Anti-Harassment Policy](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-ietf-anti-harassment-policy-20131103/)
