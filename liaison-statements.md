This pape provides guidance for WG chair to handling incoming or out-going liaison statements.

All liaison statements need to be recorded in the datatracker: https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/

For any question on handling of liaison statements or liaison management in general, please reach out to the IAB liaison coordinators: liaison-coordination@iab.org

Additional information about the IAB's role in liaison management can be found here, including the information who is currently serving as Liaison Coordinator.

For questions on one specific SDO where we have a liaison manager, you can also reach out directly to the liaison manager. All current  liaison managers are listsed here: https://www.ietf.org/about/liaisons/

If we do not have a liaison manager for the SDO that you are interesed in, please reach out to the IAB liaison coordinators: liaison-coordination@iab.org

## General Information about Liaison relationships and Liaison Statements

Main Take-aways:
* We have the liaison system to communication and work well with other SDOs e.g. for document access or process/technical question, but if possible informal communication is preferred!
Liaison statements can be sent and received without a formal relationship
* A formal liaison relationship is only needed if there are formal requirements from the other SDO or an extended need for collaboration
* Formal process on our side is light but it is important that all LSs (incoming and outgoing) get recorded!
* When sending a liaison statement always involve the liaison manager (or IAB coordinators)!
* WG chair have to assess the needed level of consensus and it is recommended to indicate consensus level clearly in the statement!
