# Setting up a new GitHub for your WG

The Secretariat can set up a GitHub organization for your WG. Please send mail to support@ietf.org with the following details:

* GitHub IDs for the WG chairs (if not already available in your Datatracker profile)
* Name of your WG
* Name desired for the Github. We use the following naming convention: `ietf-foo-wg`

## Transitioning a GitHub that already exists

If your Github organization already exists, please do the following:

* Add the user `ietf-secretariat` as an Owner of your repository.
* If not already done, please change the name to follow the `ietf-foo-wg` format.
* Send email to support@ietf.org with a link to the Github. 




### Further details

RFC 8874 and RFC 8875 outline more details about how to use GitHub for IETF work. Questions can be sent to support@ietf.org.
