This statement provides IESG guidance on interim IETF working group meetings, both face-to-face and virtual, including **timing and approvals for scheduling meetings**. (Aug 2023)

**[Information for chairing WG & BOF sessions at IETF Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/preparation/)**
See the "Information for Session Chairs" section for checklists, slide templates, and details about how to use Meetecho.

**[Important dates for upcoming IETF meetings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates/)**
Provides deadlines related to requesting sessions and registering for IETF meetings.

**[Managing meetings training](../managing-meetings/)**
These courses were first presented in 2021 with the goal of helping WG Chairs organize and run effective meetings that achieve clear outcomes.

# Roles in organizing meetings
[RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html) Provides some further detail about various roles related to organizing and running an IETF Working Group meeting.

## Working Group Secretary
The Secretary’s job is to record WG decisions and help organize group activities at a high level. For example, the Secretary may help identify session note takers, but the role responsibilities do not include taking notes directly. Secretaries are designated by WG Chairs. More information about the WG Secretary role is available in [Section 6.2 of RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html#section-6.2). Further information is also available in [an expired Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-secretaries-good-practices/) which, even though it never achieved IETF consensus, may provide useful guidance. Serving as a WG Secretary may also provide useful insight and experience for individuals considering serving as a WG Chair.

## Group Session Notetaker
Every Working Group session has notes taken to ensure important discussion points and decisions are recorded. The approach to taking notes varies by group and individual, and as most group sessions are now recorded, they do not need to be verbatim. Thus, note takers should be familiar with the general topics and individuals involved in a group, but they do not need to be deep experts. Note takers are usually volunteer or several volunteers by group chairs, often identified at the start of a session.

## Session Scribe
Working session scribes help bridge in-person sessions for remote participations, particularly those who aren’t able to follow along with video. They can convey actions taken in the room via group chat, and also convey questions or comments from remote participants to the in-person session. In-depth technical knowledge generally is not required and Working Group chairs are always happy to have volunteers at the beginning of sessions.

## Working Group Consultant
WG Consultants have specific technical background appropriate to the WG and experience in Internet architecture and IETF process. At the discretion of the responsible Area Director, a Consultant may be assigned to a working group.

# Scheduling tools
The IETF Datatracker tools for meetings require login and are restricted to individuals with specific roles.
