# Information and resources

**[IESG Guidance on Face-to-Face and Virtual Interim Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/interim-meetings-guidance/)**
This statement provides IESG guidance on interim IETF working group meetings, both face-to-face and virtual, including **timing and approvals for scheduling meetings**. (Aug 2023)

**[Information for chairing WG & BOF sessions at IETF Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/preparation/#chairs)**
See the "Information for Session Chairs" section for checklists, slide templates, and details about how to use Meetecho.

**[Important dates for upcoming IETF meetings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates/)**
Provides deadlines related to requesting sessions and registering for IETF meetings.

**[Managing meetings training](../managing-meetings/)**
These courses were first presented in 2021 with the goal of helping WG Chairs organize and run effective meetings that achieve clear outcomes.

**General workflow diagram for scheduling, holding, and following up on Working Group meetings**
To be developed.

# Roles in organizing meetings
[RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html) Provides some further detail about various roles related to organizing and running an IETF Working Group meeting. A [webpage describes more of the formally defined roles](https://www.ietf.org/participate/roles/) within the IETF, what is required to serve in that role, and how to engage in or where/who to contact to find out more about that role.

## Working Group Secretary
The Secretary’s job is to record WG decisions and help organize group activities at a high level. For example, the Secretary may help identify session note takers, but the role responsibilities do not include taking notes directly. Secretaries are designated by WG Chairs. More information about the WG Secretary role is available in [Section 6.2 of RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html#section-6.2). Further information is also available in [an expired Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-secretaries-good-practices/) which, even though it never achieved IETF consensus, may provide useful guidance. Serving as a WG Secretary may also provide useful insight and experience for individuals considering serving as a WG Chair.

## Group Session Notetaker
Every Working Group session has notes taken to ensure important discussion points and decisions are recorded. The approach to taking notes varies by group and individual, and as most group sessions are now recorded, they do not need to be verbatim. Thus, note takers should be familiar with the general topics and individuals involved in a group, but they do not need to be deep experts. Note takers are usually volunteer or several volunteers by group chairs, often identified at the start of a session.

## Session Scribe
Working session scribes help bridge in-person sessions for remote participations, particularly those who aren’t able to follow along with video. They can convey actions taken in the room via group chat, and also convey questions or comments from remote participants to the in-person session. In-depth technical knowledge generally is not required and Working Group chairs are always happy to have volunteers at the beginning of sessions.

## Working Group Consultant
WG Consultants have specific technical background appropriate to the WG and experience in Internet architecture and IETF process. At the discretion of the responsible Area Director, a Consultant may be assigned to a working group.

# Scheduling tools
The IETF Datatracker tools for meetings require login and are restricted to individuals with specific roles.

**[IETF Meeting session request tool](https://datatracker.ietf.org/secr/sreq/)**
See [instructions for using the session request tool](/meetings/session-request-instructions)

**[Interim WG meeting session request tool](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim/request/)**
See [instructions for organizing interim meetings](/meetings/interim-meeting-instructions)

**Meeting materials [submission](https://datatracker.ietf.org/cgi-bin/wg/wg_proceedings.cgi) and [management](https://datatracker.ietf.org/cgi-bin/wg/wg_proceedings.cgi)**

# Meeting planning templates, guides, and tools

## Guide for using the IETF Note Well

The IESG guidance on when/how the Note Well is displayed is:
* Show the Note Well slide at the start of every session
* Preserve the text as is, preserve the links and not add anything to it 
* Do not add the Note Really Well slide or create any other slides about policies

The IESG guidance on how to present the Note Well is:

> **DO** {.is-success}
1. Do give people 30 seconds to 1 minute so people have enough time to read through the slide before you move on (a timer is helpful).
2. Do give a high-level summary of what’s covered in the Note Well. (see below)
3. Do encourage people to read through all the linked policies & documents in detail before participating or contributing.
4. Do explain where people can direct questions or concerns (Working Group Chairs or Area Directors).

> **DON'T** {.is-warning}
1. Don’t dismiss the importance or relevance of any of the information on the Note Well.
2. Don’t interpret the meaning or get into the substance of any of the topics or content of the policies.
3. Don’t communicate that the Note Well conveys all the information participants need to know.
4. Don’t address questions or concerns in the meeting itself.

#### Sample text
Here is an example of what can be said while showing the Note Well slide:

> This is the IETF Note Well. It is a reminder about the processes and policies—including about conduct, privacy, and intellectual property rights–you agree to follow when you participate in the IETF. Please read it carefully. You are encouraged to read the source documents to which the Note Well refers. If you have questions, please talk to the Working Group chairs or Area Directors.
