Welcome to a resource site for chairs and others providing leadership and support for [IETF Working Groups](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/) (WGs) and [IRTF](https://www.irtf.org) [Research Groups](https://irtf.org/groups).

## General resources

### [IPR policy and disclosures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/about/)

[RFC6702](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6702.html) describes some strategies that may be used by working group chairs and working group secretaries to promote compliance with the IPR disclosure rules, which is essential to the accurate development of community consensus around documents produced within the IETF stream.
