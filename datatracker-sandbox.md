This [test instance of the IETF Datatracker](https://dt-main.dev.ietf.org) is a great way to experiment with various features of the IETF Datatracker and get more familiar with its capabilities, without actually making any changes to the production system.

It is kept in sync with the current [production IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org) release. The database is resynchronized daily (which means any changes you make will be overwritten by a copy of the production database within a day).

You can login with any valid username, usually a person's email address. Log in as users with different roles to see how the views change by role. All account passwords have been set to: `password`.

It is safe to perform any action in any role on the IETF Datatracker test instance as:

- the production database will not be affected and
- no email will be sent, even if it would have been in the production system.
